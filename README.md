# MATLAB-GPS-Calculations
This is a list of functions that calculate mercantor projections and UTM coordinate conversion in order to use relative cartesian based coordinate systems.


This is a list of functions I developed while interning at Audi AG. The math and code behind the mercator projections used in this project are well established and thus the following functions created by Rafael Palacios have been used without modification:
	* deg2utm
	* utm2deg
All remaining functions have been developed by Alexander Buczynsky
